# Configuration for testing identifier sanitization
#
# This config migrates tables with problematic identifiers that require
# PostgreSQL sanitization (spaces, special chars, mixed case, etc.)
#
# Setup:
#   1. Run test_identifiers.sql against your MSSQL source database
#   2. Set environment variables:
#      export MSSQL_PASSWORD="YourStrong@Passw0rd"
#      export PG_PASSWORD="postgres"
#   3. Run migration:
#      ./mssql-pg-migrate -c examples/config-identifier-test.yaml run
#
# Expected tables created in PostgreSQL:
#   - useraccounts (from UserAccounts)
#   - customer_orders (from "Customer Orders")
#   - product_catalog (from "Product$Catalog")
#   - order_items (from "Order-Items")
#   - col_1stquartersales (from "1stQuarterSales")
