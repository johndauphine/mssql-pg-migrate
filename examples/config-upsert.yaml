# Incremental Sync Configuration (Upsert Mode)
#
# Upsert mode performs incremental synchronization:
# - INSERT new rows (not in target)
# - UPDATE changed rows (all columns compared)
# - LEAVE rows that exist only in target (no deletes)
#
# Requirements:
# - All tables must have primary keys
# - Target tables must have matching PK constraints (auto-created if missing)
#
# Performance Notes:
# - Upsert is slower than bulk copy (COPY/TDS bulk) due to:
#   - Index maintenance during writes
#   - Row-by-row conflict detection
#   - Transaction logging of updates
# - Expect 2-5x slower throughput compared to drop_recreate mode
# - PostgreSQL uses batched multi-row INSERT...ON CONFLICT
# - SQL Server uses staging table + UPDATE/INSERT (with EXCEPT-based change
#   detection for efficiency)
#
# Usage:
#   export MSSQL_PASSWORD="your-mssql-password"
#   export PG_PASSWORD="your-postgres-password"
#   ./mssql-pg-migrate -c examples/config-upsert.yaml run
#
# For initial sync (empty target), upsert mode behaves like bulk insert.
# For subsequent syncs, only changed/new rows are processed.
